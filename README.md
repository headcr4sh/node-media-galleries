media-galleries
===============

This module offers access to operating-specific media galleries for Node.js / IO.js.
The main purpose of this module is to allow Electron-based apps to browse the various
operating-specific media galleries. The goal of this module is to provide an API that
comes close to the functionality of chrome.mediaGalleries for Google Chrome extensions.
